# EventRelay

This service accepts a payment command, stores the payment and its integration event in one PostgreSQL transaction, and publishes committed outbox rows to Kafka.

It focuses on the failure window that matters in this pattern. A process can stop after Kafka acknowledges an event but before PostgreSQL records it as published. The row will be retried and Kafka may receive the event again, so the included consumer records processed event IDs in the same transaction as its projection update.

The project is an independent implementation built with synthetic data. It does not contain employer code or proprietary payment rules.

## Write path

`POST /payments` requires an `Idempotency-Key`. The service takes a PostgreSQL transaction-scoped advisory lock derived from that key, then checks or creates the command. The payment row and `payment.accepted.v1` outbox row commit together.

```text
HTTP command
  └─ PostgreSQL transaction
       ├─ payment
       └─ outbox_event (PENDING)

outbox poller
  ├─ SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
  ├─ Kafka send with acks=all
  └─ PUBLISHED, delayed retry, or DEAD

Kafka consumer
  └─ PostgreSQL transaction
       ├─ processed_event
       └─ payment_projection
```

The same idempotency key and request returns the original payment. Reusing the key with another account, amount or currency returns `409`. Money is stored as `numeric(19,2)` and request hashing uses its canonical two-decimal representation.

## Delivery behavior

Publishers claim ordered batches with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, allowing several instances to work without selecting the same row. A failed send increments the attempt count and schedules exponential backoff from 1 second to 5 minutes. After eight attempts the row moves to `DEAD` for operator review.

Kafka producer idempotence reduces duplicates produced by retries inside the client, but it cannot close the database/Kafka commit gap. The application therefore describes its contract as at-least-once. The sample consumer's `processed_event` primary key makes repeated delivery a no-op. Malformed consumer records are retried three times and then published to `payment-events.DLT`.

## Run locally

Requirements are Java 21, Maven and Docker.

```bash
docker compose up -d
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Create a payment:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: checkout-481' \
  -d '{"accountId":"3b239b56-c8ef-4ca1-af51-83ac019be6dd","amount":"1250.40","currency":"RUB"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/payments
```

PostgreSQL and Kafka addresses can be changed with `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`.

## Verification

```bash
mvn verify
```

Unit tests cover acknowledgement, retry scheduling, dead-state transition and canonical request hashes. Testcontainers integration tests run PostgreSQL 17 and Apache Kafka and cover atomic row creation, same-key replay, changed-payload conflict, concurrent retries, Kafka publication and consumer deduplication.

## Boundaries

- The publisher holds PostgreSQL row locks while waiting for Kafka acknowledgement. This keeps the state transition small and explicit, but batch size and send timeout must remain bounded.
- `DEAD` rows require an operator-driven replay policy; this repository does not include an administration endpoint.
- The consumer projection is deliberately small. A real service would give each downstream consumer its own durable deduplication boundary.
- The example has no authentication or tenant model and is intended for local engineering work, not direct internet exposure.
